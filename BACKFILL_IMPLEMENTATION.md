# Backfill Feature Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the backfill functionality for the auto-pdf application as requested in GitHub issue #1.

## Overview

The backfill feature automatically scans a selected folder for existing PowerPoint files (.ppt, .pptx, .pptm) that don't have corresponding PDF files and converts them immediately after folder selection.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Monitoring States

Added new states to `MonitoringStatus` enum in `lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart`:
- `scanning`: When the app is scanning the folder for existing files
- `converting`: When the app is converting existing PowerPoint files

### 2. Progress Tracking

Added progress tracking properties to `AppStateProvider`:
- `totalFilesToConvert`: Total number of files to convert
- `currentConversionIndex`: Current file being converted
- `conversionProgress`: Formatted progress string (e.g., "2 of 5")

### 3. Core Backfill Logic

Implemented `scanAndConvertExistingFiles()` method in `FileWatcherService`:
- Scans directory for all files
- Identifies PowerPoint files (.ppt, .pptx, .pptm)
- Checks for corresponding PDF files
- Queues files for conversion that don't have PDFs
- Processes conversion queue with progress tracking

### 4. UI Updates

Updated status display widget to show:
- New scanning and converting states with appropriate colors
- Conversion progress during backfill process
- Updated help text based on current state

Updated monitoring control widget to:
- Disable buttons during scanning/converting
- Provide contextual help text

### 5. Workflow Integration

Modified folder selection workflow:
1. User selects folder
2. Automatic scan starts immediately
3. Files without PDFs are converted
4. Normal monitoring begins after backfill completes

## Key Features

### Automatic Backfill
- Triggered immediately after folder selection
- No manual intervention required
- Seamless transition to normal monitoring

### Progress Feedback
- Real-time status updates
- Progress tracking during conversion
- Clear UI indicators for each phase

### File Type Support
- Supports .ppt, .pptx, and .pptm files
- Case-insensitive file extension matching
- Proper PDF correspondence checking

### Error Handling
- Graceful error handling during scan and conversion
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- UI feedback for errors

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   ```
   mkdir test_folder
   cd test_folder
   # Create some PowerPoint files
   # Create some PDF files with matching names
   # Leave some PowerPoint files without PDFs
   ```

2. **Test Backfill Process:**
   - Launch the application
   - Select the test folder
   - Observe automatic scanning and conversion
   - Verify only files without PDFs are converted
   - Confirm monitoring starts after backfill

3. **Test UI States:**
   - Verify status changes: idle → scanning → converting → monitoring
   - Check progress display during conversion
   - Confirm buttons are disabled during backfill
   - Validate help text updates

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
flutter test test/backfill_test.dart
```

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
- `lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart`: Added new states and progress tracking
- `lib/services/file_watcher_service.dart`: Added backfill scanning logic
- `lib/screens/main_screen_simple.dart`: Integrated backfill into folder selection
- `lib/widgets/status_display_widget.dart`: Updated UI for new states
- `lib/widgets/monitoring_control_widget.dart`: Updated button states and help text

### New Files:
- `test/backfill_test.dart`: Unit tests for backfill functionality
- `BACKFILL_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: This documentation

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ Immediately after folder selection, scan is initiated
✅ Scan identifies .ppt, .pptx, and .pptm files
✅ System checks for corresponding PDF files
✅ Files without PDFs are queued for conversion
✅ Files with existing PDFs are skipped
✅ Conversion queue is processed sequentially
✅ UI provides clear feedback during process
✅ Application enters monitoring mode after completion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Parallel conversion processing (with resource limits)
- Conversion progress bar with percentage
- Option to skip backfill process
- Detailed conversion statistics
- Resume capability for interrupted conversions
